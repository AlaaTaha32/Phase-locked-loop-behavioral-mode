# Phase-locked-loop-behavioral-model
Phase-Locked Loop, or PLL in short, is a feedback control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input reference signal. PLLs are widely used in various electronic systems for a range of applications due to their ability to provide stable and controllable frequency and phase relationships.
Behavioral models for PLL type II components are implemented using Verilog-A. The models are tested using Cadence Virtuoso.

# PLL Type II Components
1- Phase Frequency Detector
2- Charge Pump
3- Loop Filter
4- Voltage-controlled Oscillator
5- Frequency Divider
